*考虑到vuetify在国内使用的人并不是特别多，我就不再给这个app以及readme提供中文版了，太麻烦了。*

*如果你完全无法阅读英文，找到Demo链接，逻辑类似填充功能，当你在触发一个按钮的时候会自动把色板的颜色部署到对应的主题色。*

## How do I use this app?

You can use the color picker to select the color you want, then click the button, the theme-color will be changed automatically. The code will show below.

## Things you have to know:

**DO NOT USE ALPHA AND IT WON'T WORK.**
Though this app can work on mobile devices, for a better experience you should rotate your screen or use PC.
For some unknow reasons, there might be a problem for Safari, which I think it's not my fault :)

### About ALPHA:

Vuetify doesn't support any color with ALPHA for themes, and there is no way to hide the ALPHA input.

### About Preview Zone:

Vuetify has many UI components, it will be a hard job for me to set all of them into preview zone. It just takes time.

## You can use it in this way:
